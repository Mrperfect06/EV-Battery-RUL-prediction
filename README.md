Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of battery performance metrics. Key features include:

Cycle_Index: The index of the charge/discharge cycle.
Discharge Time (s): Duration of the discharge phase.
Decrement 3.6-3.4V (s): Time spent in the voltage range of 3.6V to 3.4V.
Max. Voltage Dischar. (V): Maximum voltage during discharge.
Min. Voltage Charg. (V): Minimum voltage during charging.
Time at 4.15V (s): Duration at a voltage of 4.15V.
Time constant current (s): Duration at constant current.
Charging time (s): Total charging duration.
Total time (s): Total cycle time.
RUL: Remaining Useful Life (target variable).
